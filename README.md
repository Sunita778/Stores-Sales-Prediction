### Problem Statement:
Nowadays, shopping malls and Big Marts keep track of individual item sales data in
order to forecast future client demand and adjust inventory management. In a data
warehouse, these data stores hold a significant amount of consumer information and
particular item details. By mining the data store from the data warehouse, more
anomalies and common patterns can be discovered.

Approach: The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning,
Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine
learning algorithms thatâ€™s best fit for the above case.

Results: You have to build a solution that should able to predict the sales of the
different stores of Big Mart according to the provided dataset.


### **About Dataset**
We have train (8523) and test (5681) data set, train data set has both input and output
variable(s). We need to predict the sales for test data set.

- `Item_Identifier`: Unique product ID
- `Item_Weight`: Weight of product
- `Item_Fat_Content`: Whether the product is low fat or not
- `Item_Visibility`: The % of total display area of all products in a store allocated to the particular product
- `Item_Type`: The category to which the product belongs
- `Item_MRP`: Maximum Retail Price (list price) of the product
- `Outlet_Identifier`: Unique store ID
- `Outlet_Establishment_Year`: The year in which store was established
- `Outlet_Size`: The size of the store in terms of ground area covered
- `Outlet_Location_Type`: The type of city in which the store is located
- `Outlet_Type`: Whether the outlet is just a grocery store or some sort of supermarket
- `Item_Outlet_Sales`: Sales of the product in the particulat store. This is the outcome variable to be predicted.
